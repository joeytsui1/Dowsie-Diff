# Functionality & MVP 
- Interactive Visual Charts/Graph/Tables 
- User inputs to fetch data from the Riot Games API
- Dynamically renders the charts and tables with data that we get back from the fetch call
- Dropped Menu with different costs of units and if clicked in a modal would show up for the unit

# Implementation Timeline
- Friday - Querying the Riot API and storing the data we get so can be implemented to  render in HTML
- Saturday - Started on individuals classes and connect all the pages to each other.
- Sunday - Setting up the HTML with needed tables and divs
- Monday - Rendering the view of User data onto the HTML by using vanilla DOM
- Tuesday - Implementing CSS styling on to the data that is showned in HTML
- Wednesday - Worked on more CSS Styling and added about modal and my social links 
- Thursday - implementing a dropdown menu demo that is for future implementation

# Future Implementation 
- Add more details in the match history such as the game time length, the date of the game, adding a button to either open a drop down or a modal and show the rest of the players that was apart of the game

- Implementing a chart to visualize the ladder point gains or losses of the user, if i am able to find a API to get that data

- Finish the drop down menu to show all of the units modal
